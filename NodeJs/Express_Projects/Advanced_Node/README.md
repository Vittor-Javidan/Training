IMPORTANT!!!

   This project came from a old repository, and with him came some issues of outdated dependencies.
   NPM audit is not enough to fix it.

   I tried to look for pull requests to solve this, but i couldn't manage to do it. Even with ppl commit sugetions to fix it, some issues just keeping happening

   There are some circular dependencies issues in the project too

   with my currently knolegde at this date, i was not capable to make it work.

   Knowing all this, i started to code this project anyways. That's because i believe even with the old versions issues, the idea of this project probably didn't changed.
   So, its not recommended to use my code here, because there is a high chance to have errors in it, due the reason to the impossibility to test it using both terminal and browser. That's not ideal, but is what i have at this moment.
