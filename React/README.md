This is the place where i put codes related to online courses

All code here don't represent the full process, but the final stage of the courses.
I mean, you can see some files that maybe can make sense, and others probably not, thats because to understand what was done, you need to watch the videos for each course.

Courses videos link will aways be toghether with their respective code inside their README.txt files
