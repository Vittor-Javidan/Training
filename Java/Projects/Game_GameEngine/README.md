In order to see the project, you need to create a project using gradle. Copy and paste the infor from this project build.gradle file and install.

Frameworks included in this project:
   LWJGL (interface between java and openGl)
   ImGui (Framwork to create window GUI components)
   Gson  (googles project to serialize objects)

Bugs Needed to fix:
   window don't start maximized with the right coordinates. You need to minimize and maximize to work normal (Will not continue this project until fix this)
