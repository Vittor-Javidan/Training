This are files created while i was studing the online playlist course "C++" from the channel "The Cherno"

Youtube Link: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb

This course is good for who actually study c++ before. First because you will not see to much to practice(In the first videos), and second because The Cherno is amazing in demystify concepts and bring subjects that are not bring often in Youtube courses. You will have nothing to demystify if you don't study c++ before.
This course is a must for sure. If you like c++ and you don't watch it, you losing a greate value here.
