In order to see the project, you need to create a react app, delete the folders "src" and "public" from the app, to copy and paste this project folders in it

features implemented by me, not included in the tutorial:

-  Code Base Fully Reaorganized...Again (I manage to reduce the amount of arguments on each handler and script)
-  Delete system implemented!!
   - This one was trick, i took 3 days to figure out why every attempt was bring too many bugs to the app. The reason was, i needed to render my texts and input elements by the changing of the  text array insted let then multiply and delete by them selfs. This was easily bring some issues like deleting the wrong element, changing component controll and messing up the textElements left. In this process i could manage to remake the hole code more clean and organized, thats why i named Version 3.
