This is a compilation of projects that i created while i was doing the course "Code 15 React Projects - Complete Course" by "John Smilga" from "Coding Addict" channel and "freeCodeCamp.org" publishing his video

The original project use a fetch to retrive the database information, but i got banned from the API, and i was luck to have a chrome window opem with the database info.
So i just made a version without fetching

In order to see the project, you need to create a react app, delete the folders "src" and "public" from the app, and the json files if its needed, to copy and paste this project folders in it.
